> **ANT on the system** (Archive Nesting Technique on the System) is a *Hierarchical Organizational Method* designed to streamline the storage, making it easier to manage and find your documents.
<!--
[...]
-->
 
### How works?
Her rules **organize files in a way that mimics a nested for categories** by following a naming convention and incremental numbering, Where the main categories are at the highest level, and each subsequent level provides more specific subcategories.
<!--
### QUICK START
1. [Download the scrip (not avaible yet)](not-available)
2. [Seeing The Rules](#-main-concepts)
3. Let's Organize!
-->
### Key Benefits of ANT System:

1. **Structured Organization:** Files are organized in a clear hierarchical structure, making navigation easy.
2. **Convenient Nomenclature:** Folders and subfolders are named with an incremental and intuitive patern, improving the organization, creation, and search of content.
3. **Clean Desktop:** A special 'Projects' folder serves as a Temporary Repository for current and future projects, eliminating the need to use the desktop for these purposes and keeping clutter-free.
4. **Master Tracking Work/School Projects:** It allows you track ongoing projects and store ideas, When a project is done you'll know it, If you need files from another project you'll know where they are.

Following this method will ensure that your Digital Storage is well-organized, Easily accessible, and Efficiently managed

Levels refer to the depth within the folder tree directory.

> [!TIP]
> The basic structure suggests 3 levels, although in some cases there may be more. However, it is recommended not to have too many levels and to use them only in certain cases.

<div align="center"> <!-- .   -   '   -   . --> <h3> 1.1 The Level 1 - (Main Categories) </h3> <!-- .   -   '   -   . -->

Is the highest hierarchy, inside from your Root Storage Folder, content the main categories;

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use an Incremental enumeration with three digits (100, 200, 300, ...), followed by a dot, followed by the Main Category name in Capitals

There are two ways to structure;
<br>If the Directory stay for a long time should be use a **"Chill Structure"**, Otherwise if it's a Temporary Directory (it'll only be used for a short period), you should be use a **‚Äúcontrol structure‚Äù**.

<div align="center"> 
  <h4>1.3.1 Chill Structure </h4>
<img src="https://github.com/MikeWorldYt/ANT-on-the-system/assets/118069844/797bbad4-cb0b-4050-b5d6-169050892212" alt="ILL_pictures_07" width="350"></div>

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Is simple, It has an incremental enumeration with two or more digits, tho it doesn't necesary go at the beginning, as it'll depend on the needs/customization of each one. 

Use if:
- You need a static sequence
- The directory is a permanent category

**Usage Suggestions:** <br>

> [!NOTE]
> That the way you organize will determine whether your support folders come before or after. <br> Remember, the order always be Symbols-Numbers-Letters."

It's ideal for projects, presentations, database, homeworks, etc. Use a naming convetion for controling and easy identification

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It has a naming convention, here is the meaning of each part;

|               |                                                            |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Identificator | It's a code label that identifies it.                       |
| Traker        | It's your tracking index, if you use.                       |
| Date          | The format is 'YY-MM-DD', within parentheses                |
| Breadcrumb    | Use current or nearby folder category name.                 |
| Holder        | Refers to client, organization, school, or reference name, within brackets |
| Name          | Is the proj, pres, DB, hw name.                             |
| Keywords      | Are descriptive words or phrases.                           |

> [!TIP]
>  It's not necessary to have all the fields, tho follow in that order, (adapt it to your needs).

Use if:
- You Need to have control
- The data is temporary and will most likely be deleted later
- Share with more people if you

**Usage Suggestions:** <br>

<h2> 2. Support Folders </h2></div>

The support folders are designed to be helpful at the current level. In that sense support the user. <br>
Each has a unique identifier, making it easy to differentiate and quickly identify them;

<div align="center"> <!-- .   -   '   -   . --> <h3> 2.1 Settings Folder (99) </h3> <!-- .   -   '   -   . -->
<img src="https://github.com/MikeWorldYt/ANT-on-the-system/assets/118069844/fc5f6fa2-b6d8-4f17-b320-8d6c4efcddb8" alt="ILL_pictures_16" width="350"></div>

Its unique identifier is '99', so you'll probably find it as '99.Settings'
This folder contains general configurations for 'ANT', for your programs, interfaces, or Operating System.

<div align="center"> <!-- .   -   '   -   . --> <h3> 2.2 Review Folder (98) </h3>  <!-- .   -   '   -   . -->
<img src="https://github.com/MikeWorldYt/ANT-on-the-system/assets/118069844/756fdbef-55d6-4319-98d6-b7244ae10fe9" alt="ILL_pictures_17" width="350"></div>

Its unique identifier is '98', so you'll probably find it as '98.math', '98.marketing' or '98.instagram'
This folder contains all your files and directories that have no classification, need renaming, or maybe are not from the current level.
In other words, they need to be reviewed before being into the system, and this folder helps you avoid mixing them with your other files.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use the identifier, followed by a dot, followed by the name of the current path or similar (preferably write it in kebab-case) 

```image_18
> image_18

e.g. 98.ACADEMIC for
e.g. 98.Portfolio
e.g. 98.MyDocuments
e.g. 98.Math
e.g. 98.CallOfDuty
e.g. 98.MrBeast(Editions)

```

<div align="center"> 
  <h4>2.2.1 Review Directory (998.Review)</h4> 
<img src="https://github.com/MikeWorldYt/ANT-on-the-system/assets/118069844/6baaf90d-a2da-4aac-b393-11ab40896e4e" alt="ILL_pictures_19" width="100"></div>

Its unique identifier is '998', so you'll find it as '998.Review' in your Root Storage;<br>
It functions as a directory for your Review folders, should content shortcuts of your Review Folders.
The intention is that you don't have to navigate directly to the path to save the files that need to be reviewed; instead, you can directly access them with the help of this folder.

> [!NOTE]
> Try to keep it updated if you create a new review folder

<div align="center"> <!-- .   -   '   -   . --> 
  <h3> 2.3 Undefined Folder (97) </h3>
</div>

Its unique identifier is '97'. so you'll probably find it as '97.Undefined', '~97.undef', '~97.agascfsa' <br>
This is a folder that will help you organize a couple of files without adding them to '98.review'.<br>
Because those files either don't belong at that level or are **needed immediately** <br>
> [!NOTE]
> It doesn't really need an identifier, but this way, you'll know to delete it when it's empty. <br>
> You can also call it '~temp', 'temporal', anyway, just remember delete it.

<div align="center"> <!-- .   -   '   -   . --> <h3> 2.4 Resources Folder (90) </h3>
</div>

```
> edit image_21
```

It's unique identifier is '90'. so you'll probably find it as '90.Resources'
This folder helps organize those files that due to their nature;
are frequently needed, provide guidelines, are presets, for use.

**Usage Suggestions:** <br>
```
> edit image_22
e.g. Templates, Presets, Effects, Materials Stock, 
e.g. Brand Style Guide, Databases, Watermarks, Scripts, App-Presets
e.g. Books, Databases, Tutorials, Articles, References
```

<div align="center"> <!-- .   -   '   -   . --> <h3> 2.5 Archive Folder (00) </h3>
</div>

```
> edit image_23
```
Its unique identifier is '00',so you'll can use it as '00.Final', '00.Ready', '00.Renders', '00.forProduction', etc. <br>
This folder it's meant contain your deliverables or already delivered items, e.g. for your projects, homeworks, presentations, or any completed job, as well as each of its subsequent versions.

> [!NOTE]
> It's only for your Final Files. <br>
> Don't create one folder for each one.

<h4> <span style="background:rgba(136, 49, 204, 0.2)"> 3.1.1 Identificators (ID) and Traker </span> </h4>

The **ID** It's a code label that identifies it. <br>
This utility is used to separate large amounts of files in the same place based on their functionality or purpose and always is in Capitals.<br>
Here is a <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTXWGayu4tMQb1W1HtCT-tmRGfwDyoRkHh1Lfsc20i9s4lNmRB_X2TTRkjC16WalbuJ9spkqwjPj019/pubhtml'>Identificator Guide</a> as reference.

The **Traker** is a record from some company/college database or personal control system and *is purely optional*.

For example, if the file is a recording that will be made into a time-lapse, it would be 'timelapse' and its identifier would be 'TML'. If it's a project, its identifier would be 'PJ'. If it's an audio recording, 'AUD'. But if the audio is for a podcast, it would be 'POD'.
Following the identifier, you could add your tracker.

<h4>3.1.2 Date</h4>

The **date** It's written in the 
<a href='https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html'>ISO 8601 Format</a>, <br>
Year followed by Month followed by Day with tow digits in kebab-case <br>
that is, like this 'YY-MM-DD' 

<h4>3.1.3 Breadcrumb</h4>

The **breadcrumb** generally, it should be the current folder name or nearvy (couple of levels up).

<h4>3.1.2 Holder</h4>

The **holder** refers to the people/organization has an intererst in the final product because is owner, client, boss, teacher, etc. <br>
In that sense should be her name within brackets
Now in some cases as well may be the name of the category or character's name.

<div align="center"> <!-- .   -   '   -   . --> <h3> 3.2. Description Data Fields </h3> <!-- .   -   '   -   . -->

Should be descriptive attributes, it's meant contain specific data that make it individual as her title name, keywords, version or sufix.

| Name     | It's the specific name given to the file.                                   |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Keywords | Tags or terms that relate to the content of the file.                       |
