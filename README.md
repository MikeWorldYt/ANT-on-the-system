> **ANT on the system** (Archive Nesting Technique on the System) is a *Hierarchical Organizational Method* designed to streamline the storage, making it easier to manage and find your documents.
<!--
[...]
-->
 
### How works?
Her rules **organize files in a way that mimics a nested for categories** by following a naming convention and incremental numbering, Where the main categories are at the highest level, and each subsequent level provides more specific subcategories.
<!--
### QUICK START
1. [Download the scrip (not avaible yet)](not-available)
2. [Seeing The Rules](#-main-concepts)
3. Let's Organize!
-->
### Key Benefits of ANT System:

1. **Structured Organization:** Files are organized in a clear hierarchical structure, making navigation easy.
2. **Convenient Nomenclature:** Folders and subfolders are named with an incremental and intuitive patern, improving the organization, creation, and search of content.
3. **Clean Desktop:** A special 'Projects' folder serves as a Temporary Repository for current and future projects, eliminating the need to use the desktop for these purposes and keeping clutter-free.
4. **Master Tracking Work/School Projects:** It allows you track ongoing projects and store ideas, When a project is done you'll know it, If you need files from another project you'll know where they are.

Following this method will ensure that your Digital Storage is well-organized, Easily accessible, and Efficiently managed

<h2> 1. Levels and Folder's Structure </h2>

Levels refer to the depth within the folder tree directory.

> [!TIP]
> The basic structure suggests 3 levels, although in some cases there may be more. However, it is recommended not to have too many levels and to use them only in certain cases.

<div align="center"> <!-- .   -   '   -   . --> <h3> 1.1 The Level 1 - (Main Categories) </h3> <!-- .   -   '   -   . -->

Is the highest hierarchy, inside from your Root Storage Folder, content the main categories;

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use an Incremental enumeration with three digits (100, 200, 300, ...), followed by a dot, followed by the Main Category name in Capitals

**Usage Suggestions:** <br>

There are two ways to structure;
<br>If the Directory stay for a long time should be use a **"Chill Structure"**, Otherwise if it's a Temporary Directory (it'll only be used for a short period), you should be use a **‚Äúcontrol structure‚Äù**.

<div align="center"> 
  <h4>1.3.1 Chill Structure </h4>
<img src="https://github.com/MikeWorldYt/ANT-on-the-system/assets/118069844/797bbad4-cb0b-4050-b5d6-169050892212" alt="ILL_pictures_07" width="350"></div>

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Is simple, It has an incremental enumeration with two or more digits, tho it doesn't necesary go at the beginning, as it'll depend on the needs/customization of each one. 

Use if:
- You need a static sequence
- The directory is a permanent category

**Usage Suggestions:** <br>

> [!NOTE]
> That the way you organize will determine whether your support folders come before or after. <br> Remember, the order always be Symbols-Numbers-Letters."

  <h4>1.3.2 Control Structure</h4>

It's ideal for projects, presentations, database, homeworks, etc. Use a naming convetion for controling and easy identification

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It has a naming convention, here is the meaning of each part;

|               |                                                            |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Identificator | It's a code label that identifies it.                       |
| Traker        | It's your tracking index, if you use.                       |
| Date          | The format is 'YY-MM-DD', within parentheses                |
| Breadcrumb    | Use current or nearby folder category name.                 |
| Holder        | Refers to client, organization, school, or reference name, within brackets |
| Name          | Is the proj, pres, DB, hw name.                             |
| Keywords      | Are descriptive words or phrases.                           |

> [!TIP]
>  It's not necessary to have all the fields, tho follow in that order, (adapt it to your needs).

Use if:
- You Need to have control
- The data is temporary and will most likely be deleted later
- Share with more people if you

Works as a temporal repository, It should contentain shortcuts to current project paths, and If you want also idea or inspiration folders

<h2> 2. Support Folders </h2></div>

The support folders are designed to be helpful at the current level. In that sense support the user. <br>
Each has a unique identifier, making it easy to differentiate and quickly identify them;

<div align="center"> <!-- .   -   '   -   . --> <h3> 2.1 Settings Folder (99) </h3> <!-- .   -   '   -   . -->
</div>

```
> image_16
```

Its unique identifier is '99', so you will find it as '99.Settings'
This folder contains general configurations for 'ANT', for your programs, interfaces, or Operating System.

<div align="center"> <!-- .   -   '   -   . --> <h3> 2.2 Review Folder (98) </h3>  <!-- .   -   '   -   . -->
</div>

```
> image_17
```

Its unique identifier is '98', so you will find it as '98.Review'
This folder contains all your files and directories that have no classification, need renaming, or maybe are not from the current level.
In other words, they need to be reviewed before being into the system, and this folder helps you avoid mixing them with your other files.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use the identifier, followed by a dot, followed by the name of the current path

```image_18
> image_18

e.g. 98.ACADEMIC for
e.g. 98.Portfolio
e.g. 98.MyDocuments
e.g. 98.Math
e.g. 98.CallOfDuty
e.g. 98.MrBeast(Editions)

```

### 2.3 Undefined Folder (97)
Its unique enumeration is '97', so you will find it as '97.UnDefined' or 97.UnCategorized'.
